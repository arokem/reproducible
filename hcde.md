# Incentivize and popularize reproducible research and open science practices

### Possible Capstone Project 

 - Work with the UW [eScience Reproducibility and Open Science Working
   Group](http://escience.washington.edu/about-us/working-groups/reproducibility-and-open-science/),
   which collaborates with parallel working groups at NYU and Berkeley
   funded by the Moore/Sloan [Data Science Environment](http://msdse.org/)
   project.

 - Investigate strategies to educate and influence researchers towards
   better practices around open science and reproducibility, e.g. to
   encourage researchers to follow these [Guidelines](guidelines.html).

 - Help expand interest and awareness beyond eScience Institute to
   researchers all around campus and beyond. 

 - Develop innovative ideas, assist in the design of effective strategies, and
   perhaps help in prototyping or implementation of new tools.

 - Current projects include development of 
   [Badges for Reproducibility and Open Science](badges.html).
