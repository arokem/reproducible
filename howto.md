# How to contribute to these pages

1. Clone this repository and checkout the `gh-pages` branch.

2. Modify the `.md` pages containing markdown.

3. View your changes locally by running through Jekyll: follow the
   directions for
   [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
   for setting up Jekyll.  Then

        $ bundle exec jekyll serve

   starts a server that can be viewed at http://localhost:4000 

        $ jekyll build

   to rebuild the pages after making changes.


4. Commit your changes and push back to Github (if you have push permission)
   or to your own fork and then issue a pull request.
