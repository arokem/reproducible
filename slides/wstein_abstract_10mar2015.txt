Reproducibility and Open Science Seminar

Speaker: William Stein, Mathematics Department

Time and date: 1:30pm on Tuesday, March 10

Place: Data Science Studio Meeting Room, 6th Floor, Physics/Astronomy Tower

Title: SageMathCloud --  collaboratively use Sage, IPython, LaTeX, and
terminals in your browser.

Abstract:  
I am a professor in the mathematics department at UW. In 2005, I founded
SageMath, which is the main large open source pure
mathematics research software (and is often used in undergraduate
teaching), with many hundreds of contributors. Sage is an open source
free download, which is pretty big and can be difficult to install.
Since 2006, we've always had some sort of web-based interface.  In
2013, I launched SageMathCloud (SMC), which is a new web interface to
Sage, with much general functionality that has little to do with Sage,
and is of interest to people outside mathematics research.  For
example, all development of SMC is done from within SMC, so SMC is
also an online development environment.  There's also support for
editing LaTeX documents, using IPython notebooks, tracking tasks, etc.

   In this talk I'll give an overview of SMC, then talk about some
incidental connections with reproducibility, including how SMC
aggressively snapshots all user files periodically, and records nearly
every keystroke (with a history slider) when editing worksheets.
